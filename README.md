This repo is a fork of liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans;

We just added the possibility to run it using `node` and `npm`

How do you run it using node:

Clone this project then run ```npm install && npm start```

This should open you a browser and give you a nice live reload

For those using WallabyJS, just run it and you'll be on your way to master JS syntax
